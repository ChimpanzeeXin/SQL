#### HAVING is unsed because WHERE cannot be used in aggregate functions

#select where column1 contains "word1"

SELECT * FROM mytable
WHERE column1 LIKE '%word1%'

#You can use the words ALL or ANY where the right side of the operator might have multiple values.
SELECT name FROM world
 WHERE population > ALL
      (SELECT population FROM world
        WHERE continent='Europe')
   
 ###Using the MAX aggregate function returns the highest GDP from the sub-query which is what you want to compare with the outer query.
 SELECT name 
  FROM world 
 WHERE gdp > (SELECT MAX(gdp) FROM world WHERE continent = 'Europe')

#We can refer to values in the outer SELECT within the inner SELECT. We can name the tables so that we can tell the difference between the 
#inner and outer versions.
SELECT continent, name, population FROM world x
  WHERE population >= ALL
    (SELECT population FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent
          AND population>0)
          
###First country of each continent (alphabetically)
SELECT continent, MIN(name) AS name
FROM world 
GROUP BY continent

###
Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.
SELECT y.name, y.continent, y.population
FROM world AS y
JOIN
(SELECT continent,max(population)
FROM world
GROUP BY continent
HAVING max(population) <= 25000000) AS x
ON y.continent = x.continent
