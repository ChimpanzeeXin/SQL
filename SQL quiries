#### HAVING is unsed because WHERE cannot be used in aggregate functions

#select where column1 contains "word1"

SELECT * FROM mytable

#You can use the words ALL or ANY where the right side of the operator might have multiple values.

 ###Using the MAX aggregate function returns the highest GDP from the sub-query which is what you want to compare with the outer query.
 SELECT name 
  FROM world 
 WHERE gdp > (SELECT MAX(gdp) FROM world WHERE continent = 'Europe')

#We can refer to values in the outer SELECT within the inner SELECT. We can name the tables so that we can tell the difference between the 
#inner and outer versions.
