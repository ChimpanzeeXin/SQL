 从数据结构开始学算法：
 **linked list
 1. Dummy head: keep the reference of head and return to the whole linked list in the end
 2. Iterate linked list (and add new node to linked list):
     cur.next = newNode
     cur = cur.next
 3. Recursion is faster than iteration?
 4. Awways to check if the head is None at the beginning
 
 一些辅助工具：
 #Hash Table
 Hash table is useful to record reference for index in array(1) or linked list(141)! But is cost space complexity O(n)
 
 #two pointers
 1. Application of fast and slow pointers
   a. fast and slow pointers will finally meet: Cyclic questions(141)
   b. find mid point of linked list by fast and slow pointers(234)
   
 
 


# Greedy Algorithm
The algorithm makes the optimal choice at each step as it attempts to find the overall optimal way to solve the entire problem. 


#Math: get rid of the first digit: number%(比number少一位的10000)
#      get rid of the last digit : number//10
#      need the first digit: number // (比number少一位的10000)
#      need the last digit number: number % 10

#Math: Digit Root
The digital root of a number is equal to the remainder when that number is divided by 9. If the remainder is 0 and the number is greater than 0, then the digital root is 9. If the number is 0, then the digital root of the number is 0.
