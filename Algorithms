# Greedy Algorithm
The algorithm makes the optimal choice at each step as it attempts to find the overall optimal way to solve the entire problem. 


#Math: get rid of the first digit: number%(比number少一位的10000)
#      get rid of the last digit : number//10
#      need the first digit: number // (比number少一位的10000)
#      need the last digit number: number % 10

#Math: Digit Root
The digital root of a number is equal to the remainder when that number is divided by 9. If the remainder is 0 and the number is greater than 0, then the digital root is 9. If the number is 0, then the digital root of the number is 0.
